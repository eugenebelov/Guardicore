# Guardicore test task

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.2.

Before start, be sure that you have nodejs > 8 and npm > 5

Ok, to get this very fancy-looking drawing board you need to do the following:
1. open your teminal/cmd/whatever and paste 
```
git clone git@github.com:eugenebelov/guardicore.git
```
2. then go to folder and type
```
npm i
```
3. If everything went smooth, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
